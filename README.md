## AI Tools Used
- Primary tools: Perplexity AI (Vibe Coder/Founding Engineer Role)
- Key use cases:
  - Generating realistic, structured mock analytics data for the dashboard
  - Designing modern, user-centric UI/UX concepts tailored for marketing analytics
  - Creating code snippets and reusable React/Next.js components for dashboard cards, tables, and interactive charts
  - Writing example logic for dark/light mode toggles, skeleton loaders, and real-time data simulation
  - Providing technical research on modern dashboard trends, animation best practices, and open-source UI libraries (e.g., shadcn/ui)

## Sample Prompts

1. “Create a dashboard metrics card layout in React with animated counting transitions and shadow effects for Revenue, Users, Conversions, Growth Rate.”
2. “Give an example of a responsive, modern donut chart component using Chart.js/Recharts for marketing channel revenue shares.”
3. “How should I architect an interactive campaign table with search, filter, and pagination using Chakra UI or shadcn/ui?”

## AI vs Manual Work Split

- *AI-generated:* 60%
  - Data mockups, chart/analytics examples, component skeletons, UI/UX design guidelines, sample code (cards, charts, tables), and boilerplate setup suggestions.
  - Code documentation (README sections, usage comments).
- *Manual coding:* 40%
  - Integrating and refining components within Next.js 14+ App Router structure.
  - Wiring up real data sources, advanced filter logic, export functionality, and deploying the live demo on Vercel/Netlify.
  - Fine-tuning styles, adding custom micro-interactions, and ensuring accessibility.
- *Customization:* 
  - Adapted AI-generated UI to fit ADmyBRAND’s unique brand, adjusting color themes, typography, spacing, and component hierarchy for a standout look.
  - Enhanced performance and polish by hand—optimizing loading states, smooth transitions, and accessibility features for a professional, client-ready finish.
